# Python_Basics_Summary

Well well well, have we gone far.

It's been a long (and tedious) journey through the basics of python.

Right now I am at a point where I would consider myself to be proficiant in the language and also skillfull enough to work in a real company and real world applications(obviously with enough learning time).

How was the learning experience?
To be honest, this was probably one of my best ideas.
Doing it this way made sure, that I HAVE to go back and understand what I did. I am at a point in time, where I can come back to old projects and understand instantly what happens in them.
It's not because I memorized the code, it's because I fundamently understand everything I wrote down. Now, with a bit of a time out even more. 

So all in all, I can say it was a Succes.

What could I do better next time?
One thing I might have to change is my time investment.
I worked this way:
2 Days for 10-30min each, learn something new.
3rd day do a project.

Not only did I feel like I progressed extremely slow (especially during the beginning where most of the things are just basics), but also the project ideas where kind of draining me.
Coming up with new things everytime was exhausting and something where I lost most of my time on the third day(sometimes I had nothing for 2 hours). This only got better, when I watched a video, where it says "just do things that are already existing, you want to learn how to code, not how to create a project". After that I finally felt really good about them(thats where I started doing Yugioh projects)


How does my future look?
